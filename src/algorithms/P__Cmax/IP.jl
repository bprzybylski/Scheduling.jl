"""
    P__Cmax_IP!(J::Vector{Job}, M::Vector{Machine}; optimizer = GLPK.Optimizer)

Solves the P||Cmax problem by applying the simple IP proposed by Drozdowski (2009, p. 23). By default, the open source GLPK optimizer together with JuMP is used. This algorithm works on original `J` and `M` vectors which are also returned with the resulting schedule. In order to use copies, see `P__Cmax_IP`.

This algorithm is based on the following job parameters: `p` (processing time).
